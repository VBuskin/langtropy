\title{Calculate Surprisal (Self-Information)}
\usage{
surprisal(p, base = 2, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A numeric vector of probabilities. Values must be between 0 and 1
(exclusive of 0, inclusive of 1).}

\item{base}{The logarithmic base to use. Default is 2 (bits). Use \code{exp(1)}
for nats, or 10 for dits/bans.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of surprisal values in the specified units.
Returns \code{Inf} for probability 0, and 0 for probability 1.
}
\description{
Computes the surprisal (also known as self-information) of an event given
its probability. Surprisal quantifies how "surprising" an event is - rare
events have high surprisal, while common events have low surprisal.
}
\details{
Surprisal is calculated as: \eqn{I(x) = -\log_b(P(x))}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \code{I(x)} is the surprisal of event x
\item \code{P(x)} is the probability of event x
\item \code{b} is the logarithmic base
}

Common bases and their units:
\itemize{
\item Base 2: bits (most common in information theory)
\item Base e: nats (natural units)
\item Base 10: dits or bans
}
}
\examples{
# Surprisal of a fair coin flip (0.5 probability)
surprisal(0.5)  # 1 bit

# Surprisal of various probabilities
probs <- c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)
surprisal(probs)

# Using different bases
surprisal(0.5, base = exp(1))  # in nats
surprisal(0.5, base = 10)      # in dits

# With a linguistic example: word frequencies
word_probs <- c(0.1, 0.05, 0.001, 0.2)  # probabilities of different words
word_surprisals <- surprisal(word_probs)
names(word_surprisals) <- c("the", "cat", "serendipity", "and")
word_surprisals
